# Firework Simulator
USER INPUT

Pyro is the main file to be run in the zip file. It was originally written using the PyCharm IDE. The program can receive user input in real time. 
The program responds to the arrow keys or the wheel on the mouse.

Functionality:
Pressing the up arrow key will shift the camera upwards to get a "birds-eye" view of the simulation. Conversely, the down arrow will shift 
the camera downwards to get a view of the underside of the terrain. Pressing the right arrow key will rotate the platform to the right. Conversely, 
the left arrow key will rotate the platform to the left. The program will respond to a single key stoke, meaning, holding down any of the arrow keys 
will not continuously shift the platform or camera angle. Additionally, the program responds to the wheel on the mouse "scrolling up" will cause the
simulation to mover further away, while "scrolling down" will cause it to move closer. This can be seen in the "Demonstration Video."
